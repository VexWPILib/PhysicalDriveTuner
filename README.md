# PhysicalDriveTuner

Use this program to tune the `wheel diameter` value and then the `wheel track` parameter.  Make sure your robot has 10-15 feet of freedom around it before running.  Use the screen to make changes to your values without having to recompile your code.  Start with moving forward and backward to dial in the value for your `wheel diameter` first, and then move on the the turn.  The robot should turn 720 degrees; adjust the value of your `wheel track` up or down until the robot turns as close to 720 degrees as you think reasonable.
